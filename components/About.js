Wes Lillig began building things at an young age. His deep-rooted passion
for making things stems from his early days in the Boy Scouts, from which
he remembers his first project making a pinewood derby car as a Cub Scout,
and then the myriad of volunteer service projects he worked as an Eagle Scout.

Following the footsteps of his father and grandfather, Wes began his
professional career as a carpenter. While working in commercial and residential
construction, he discovered his knack for working through complicated builds.
After one project took him from sheet rock and studs to lumber and custom molding
profiles, Wes became hooked on finer work and decided to pursue formal training.

In 2014, Wes moved from Kansas City to Boston to begin his studies of Cabinetry
and Furniture at the North Bennet Street School where he would begin refining his
skills for making fine furniture. He would later receive the Ddora Foundation
Grant for "excellence in preserving American craftsmanship", graduating in the spring of 2016.

Today, Wes continues to fulfill his passion for woodworking. He specializes in
designing and building custom furniture full-time as a member of the Charlestown
Furniture Makers Co-op. He has completed projects ranging from custom restaurant
tables and bars, kitchen cabinets and islands, dining tables and coffee tables,
chairs and stools, end tables and night stands, even jewelry boxes and cutting boards.
He also teaches private lessons.

In his free time, Wes enjoys playing rugby, cooking, and tending to his bonsai.
